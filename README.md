# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization

This project is a Python-based sorting algorithm visualizer designed to help me experiment with Python and gain a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms. The program provides a visual representation of various sorting techniques, making it easier to analyze their behavior and efficiency.

# Features

Supports multiple sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.)

Real-time visualization of sorting steps

Adjustable speed and array size

Interactive and educational

# Usage

Run the script, select a sorting algorithm, and watch how it operates step by step. Perfect for learners and those curious about algorithm behavior!
